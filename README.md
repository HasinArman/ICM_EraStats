### EraStats is an analytical tool designed to help users gain insights into the prevalence of various medical conditions over time. Users can select specific health conditions, such as depression or diabetes, and view statistics broken down by age, gender, and clinical status. This data-driven approach provides a comprehensive understanding of how different factors influence the incidence of diseases. EraStats is ideal for healthcare professionals, researchers, and individuals interested in historical and demographic trends in healthcare, as it allows them to identify patterns and potentially make data-informed decisions or predictions for public health initiatives.
