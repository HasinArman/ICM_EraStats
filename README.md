### EraStats is an analytical tool designed to help users gain insights into the prevalence of various medical conditions over time. Users can select specific health conditions, such as depression or diabetes, and view statistics broken down by age, gender, and clinical status. This data-driven approach provides a comprehensive understanding of how different factors influence the incidence of diseases. EraStats is ideal for healthcare professionals, researchers, and individuals interested in historical and demographic trends in healthcare, as it allows them to identify patterns and potentially make data-informed decisions or predictions for public health initiatives.



# Specific Problem to Solve: Allergy and Intolerance Management
## For the user (a healthcare provider or patient), the specific problem being solved is preventing allergic reactions that could result from prescribing medications or consuming foods that the individual is allergic to. ## The user needs a way to quickly identify and alert them to potential allergies, ensuring that medications and foods are safe for the patient.



# What Are They Trying to Get Done?
## The user is trying to manage allergy information effectively. Specifically, they need to:
### 1. Identify allergies: Quickly review the patient's known allergies (e.g., medication, food).
### 2. Alert system: Get notified when a potentially harmful substance (like a medication or food) is prescribed or recommended based on the patient's allergy data.
### 3. Track allergy history: Update, verify, and manage the patientâ€™s allergy information over time.

# What Could Be Data to Manipulate When Interacting with One Record?
## When interacting with a record of AllergyIntolerance (specifically for one patient), the following data could be manipulated:
### 1. Substance (Allergen): The medication or food the patient is allergic to (e.g., penicillin, peanuts).
### 2. Reaction Type: The specific allergic reaction (e.g., rash, anaphylaxis)
### 4. Verification Status: Whether the allergy has been confirmed or not.
### 5. Clinical Status: Whether the allergy is currently active or resolved.
###6. Date of Allergy Onset: When the allergy was first identified or reported.
